    "text": "Task 3 - Using RStudio\n\nIntroducing R Studio\nR and RStudio is the software that we will be using to explore and learn about analysis in your Psychology degree. It’s a computational engine: a very snazzy calculator that you should see as your friend and ally in the journey to understand and appreciate psychology. It sits alongside what we teach about the concepts and interpretation of statistical analysis.\nR is the core software, RStudio is the interface for interacting with it. Put another way, R is the engine, RStudio is the cockpit.\nLike even a simplest calculator, it just does what you ask (at least when you ask nicely!) but it requires the user to know what they want from it and to understand what it is telling you. A calculator can’t help a kid get the right answer to a multiplication problem if they don’t know the difference between multiplication and division and addition etc. And whilst a calculator is brilliant at doing the number crunching (and as a bonus, R Studio can help with turning the numbers into beautiful graphs and images too), even a calculator requires a thoughtful person to take the answers and make sensible interpretations from them.\nTherefore, we need to learn both about the concepts of statistical analysis on the one hand, and the processing of statistical information -through R- on the other. The lectures will provide the starting point and the direction for statistical concepts, whilst these analysis labs provide the more practical experiences in how to use R, and how to make R your ally. Over the next year, in these labs we will increasingly be using RStudio to focus on the latter, processing side, which will allow you to focus your energies on the conceptual side and its relevance for appreciating psychology.\n\n\nGetting started with RStudio\nFor Lancaster University Psychology Students in 2023, we will be learning about R Studio through a simple but powerful web server architecture. That is, through the power of the internet, you can access and use R Studio by logging into a free account that we have provided and we will maintain for your use.\n\nHere’s a little secret: There are several different ways to access RStudio. For example, you can download a copy of the software onto your computer, or use a Virtual Machine set up to run a copy. There’s nothing to stop you having your local copy, but please note - we can’t support your own version through lab classes. We’re using the web server to make sure everyone has the same, controlled experience.\n\nTo log in to the R server, first make sure that you have the VPN switched on, or you will need to be connected to the university network (Eduroam). To set up the VPN, follow ISS instructions here or connecting to Eduroam here.\nWhen you are connected, navigate to https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk, where you will be shown a login screen that looks like the below. Click the option that says “Sign in with SAML”.\n \nThis will take you through to the University login screen, where you should enter your username (e.g. ivorym) and then your university password. This will then redirect you to the R server where you can start using RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have already logged in through the university login already, perhaps to get to the portal, then you may not see the username/password screen. When you click login, you will be redirected straight to RStudio. This is because the server shares the login information securely across the university.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does RStudio look like?\nWhen RStudio starts, it will look something like this: \nRStudio has three panels or windows: there are tabs for Console (taking up the left hand side), Environment (and History top right) , Current file (bottom right). You will also see a 4th window for a script or set of commands you develop, also (on the left hand side).\n\n\nLet’s get started!\nThe first thing we want to do in RStudio is to create a folder for this week so that we can put the relevant material there and keep it tidy.\nFrom the lower-right panel of RStudio, click the files tab.\nSelect the “new folder” option and create a new folder (eg “week 1”)\nClick on that folder to open it\nNext, we’ve prepared some instructions for RStudio to use - this is called a “script”. So we need to get this script into the server for you to explore and play with\n\nDownload the “zip” file by clicking this link\nFind the location of the file on your computer and check it is saved as a “.zip” file\nReturn to RStudio\nClick “Upload”\nClick choose file and find the file on your computer.\nSelect the file and click “Open”. Click “OK”\n\nYou should now see the files extracted in the directory.\nYou should now have the script available in RStudio.\nUse “Save…As” to create a new version of the script. By doing this, you’ll be able to have a “before” and “after” version of the script and can go back over the changes\nIn the script, select or highlight the first line of text, which is this one:\n\nRun your first ever R instruction!\n\n5 + 5\n\nand “run” this line. That tells RStudio to carry out the instruction.\nYou should see that in the console tab, RStudio calculates the answer to this incredibly hard maths challenge! (amazing huh? OK, maybe not *that* amazing…).\n\n\nModify your first ever R instruction!\nUse your imagination – add a new line to the script and ask a different simple arithmetic question of your own choosing! What happens?\n\n\nCalculate descriptive stats in R for the first time!\nIn this week’s analysis lecture, we looked at measures of central tendency and how to calculate them. So let’s get R to do these calculations also!\nFirst, we tell R about the data used in the lecture. We’ve already created the instruction that will do exactly this and it is in the script, so run this line from the script\n\nweek_1_lecture_data &lt;- c(7,8,8,7,3,1,6,9,3,8)\n\nThis creates an “object” called week_1_lecture_data. We can then perform calculations on this object. For example, we can find the mean by running the following command (use the script to do this)\n\nmean(week_1_lecture_data)\n\nCheck the answer is the same we found in the lecture (it should be 6!).\nNext, let’s ask for the median by running this line from the script:\n\nmedian(week_1_lecture_data)\n\nThis also should be the answer from the lecture (7)\nR doesn’t have a single corresponding command for the mode, but we can use the block of code in the script for this that starts and ends with the “getmode” text (there are 6 lines of text)\nThis is just a bit of clever jiggery-pokery that gets the mode. What does R say the mode is?\n\n\nYour challenge\nHow can you get RStudio to verify / check the dice calculations that you attempted earlier? Think about how you might solve this problem, on the basis of what we have covered so far.\nWe will discuss this in class and attempt to get RStudio to check your answers. In doing so, annotate the script (add notes for you - not RStudio) using the “#” command"

    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to the PSYC121 lab material for 2023!\nIn this module you will learn the basics of data handling, data processing and data visualisation. What that means is that, by the end of the this module (at Christmas time), you will be able to take a set of data, look at some basic statistics (e.g., the mean value), filter and process the data in order to answer basic questions about it, and present the data in an appealing way with different graphs. On top of this, you will be able to apply some of your knowledge of the basic “inferential” statistical tests that we will introduce in the lecture series (e.g., “t-test”).\nIn Week 1 we will introduce you to the software that we use to do all this useful work in statistics: “R” and “RStudio”. This is a coding language, and you will be taught the basics of how to write code in order to do all of the above key steps in data analysis. This tuition will continue in Term 2, and in your statistics modules in Year 2. Coding is challenging, but we know from experience that those students who attend classes, who work through the exercises carefully, and who seek help when they need it, do very well on these modules.\nMost of all, it’s important that you recognise that data analysis (statistics) is a critical aspect of the study of psychology. When we want to understand behaviour, we take measurements of that behaviour, which the majority of the time will result in quantitative (numerical) data. In order to understand the behaviour in a meaningful way, we need to conduct all of the above steps in our data analysis workflow. In summary, we cannot investigate psychological processes without the skills and toolbox of statistics and data analysis techniques.\n\n\nWorking at your own pace and seeking help\nWe have carefully prepared and refined the lab materials in this course over several years, and we feel that the pace of the materials is just right for our students. Some students will complete them more quickly, and others more slowly - both of these scenarios are absolutely fine. You should work at the pace that suits you best, making sure you understand the materials before you move forward.\nIt is fairly inevitable that you will get stuck on the lab materials in this module at some point. This might be in Week 1, Week 2, or later. When you do, it’s important you reach out for help:\n\nAsk your friends on your table. We’ve designed this teaching space to help collaborative work. You are encouraged to work with other students. Make sure you ask others to explain how they’ve solved an exercise. Make sure you help out others where you can. Always make sure you understand the code and the exercise; don’t simply be satisfied that you’ve got the right answer.\nAsk a GTA or Lecturer. Our Graduate Teaching Assistants are there to help you. There are no “stupid questions” in statistics, so just ask the GTAs any question about what you’re doing. Likewise, ask the Lecturer.\nAsk on the Discussion Forum. On the PSYC121 moodle page you will find a Discussion Forum. This is a great way to ask a question outside of the lab sessions. It might seem scary to ask a question in the forum, but please don’t be afraid to do this. If you have a question, you can bet 30+ other students also have the same question! So by asking the question on the forum, you help out many more people on the module. A friendly GTA or Lecturer will be along to answer the question as soon as possible (we aim for within 48 hours during the working week).\nAsk on the module Q & A session. Each week we hold a “Q&A” online session where we will try and resolve any general queries and problems. It’s an ideal time to discuss things that students are struggling with or confused about, and can share ideas and answers. You can ask on the discussion forum above and then we might be able to pick up the issues and discuss them, but also you can ask in the session itself.\n\nAsking good questions - it’s really important that you give us as much information as you can when you ask your questions (in class and especially on the forum). It’s so much harder to help respond to “I can’t do Exercise 5 in Week 7” (because we don’t know why it is that you can’t do it) than for example “In Exercise 5 of Week 7, I’ve managed to read in the data, put the graph looks quite odd. Here is the code I’m using…”\n\n\nCourse Contacts\nIf you have something that needs to be private, then please feel free to email the academic staff at the email addresses below:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\nTom Beesley (Coordinator)\nt.beesley at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\nJohn Towse\nj.towse at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
