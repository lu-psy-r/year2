# Introduction

This week is a crossover week between Amy and Emma. 

Factor Analysis content is needed for learning. Questions will not be asked
in the class test in week 20 on the Factor Analysis method. 

The Binomial Test content is needed for learning, and the **class test**.

The rest of this page is split into two parts, Factor Analysis and
Binomial Test. They each have their own associated lecture and notes.

# Factor Analysis

Watch the Lecture on Factor Analysis
[here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=1978201)

Factor analysis is an analysis method that aims to take a large number
of observed variables, and reduce these to a smaller set of distinct
underlying latent variables. In the example below, we have the observed
variables on the left. These are the things we can measure, or observe.
On the right, we see the latent variables (PA1, PA2, PA3, and PA4),
these are not directly measured by us (hence the term latent) and
represent a reduction of variables. This is done through measuring how
the observed variables "load" onto the latent variables (the loadings
are the numbers on the arrows, higher loadings indicate stronger links
to that latent variable) -- they correlate more with each other than the
other variables, which can indicate that they measure a similar
underlying variable.

You may have taken a personality test, or other questionnaire style test
where a lot of the questions seemed to ask about similar things. In the
big five mini-IPIP scale, the two questions for extraversion are "Am the
life of the party" and "Talk to a lot of different people at parties".
The expectation is that if there is indeed an underlying variable behind
these two questions, then people's responses should be similar to both
questions (score 5 - strongly agree to one statement and you'd probably
score the other the same).

Measures of association help answer the question 'What is the
relationship between two variables?'

Correlation looks at pairs of **numerical** variables

-   X & Y below predict Z
-   X & Y are completely separate
-   X & Y are completely independent of each other

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']
  tab3 [label = '@@3']

  tab1 -> tab3;
  tab2 -> tab3;

  {rank=same; tab1, tab2}

}
  
  [1]: 'X'
  [2]: 'Y'
  [3]: 'Z'
  ") 
```

-   X & Y below predict Z
-   X & Y are completely separate
-   X & Y are completely independent of each other

X is showing a larger correlation with Z than Y here

You can draw the diagram like this to show how much information X shares
with Z and how much Y shares with Z

![Correlation of variables](Images/Wk5/Correlation1.png)

Sometimes the relationship between X & Y is not so independent: + X & Y
here still predict Z + X & Y but now they are not completely separate +
X & Y they share some information + They are correlated with each
other + As well as being correlated with Z

![Correlation of variables](Images/Wk5/Correlation2.png)

We can draw this this way too...

The overlap between X & Y is still independent of their overlap with Z

![Correlation of variables](Images/Wk5/Correlation3.png)

In this example, the overlap between X & Y is now related to the overlap
with Z to a much greater degree...

## Multicollinearity

When we have too much overlap between our predictor variables it can be
a problem. This is called **multicollinearity**.

When you have many predictor variables you need to check that they are
not too highly correlated with each other. You do this by calling a
correlation plot, where correlations \> .80 may be problematic. If you
have lots of observations, you may be okay, but your model may have
problems

### Mitigation

Choose a smaller set of variables 

+ By theory Group together alike variables 
+ Principal component analysis Estimate underlying structures 
+ Factor analysis 
+ Underlying structures are also known as
"latent variables"

## Factor Analysis

Finding underlying structure or latent variables + Latent variables
should have three or more observed variables loading onto them +
Correlations between those observed variables should be high + The
observed variables should load only onto one variable

Before beginning: 

+ Standardise your variables

Factor analysis is quite jargon heavy:

*Exploratory factor analysis* (EFA) and *Confirmatory factor analysis*
(CFA)

Where there is overlap, where variables '*load*' onto factors:

The shared variance is called '*communality*'

And the unshared variance is called *uniqueness*

### Performance

1.  A factor should have at least three variables that are loaded to a
    sufficient level
2.  Any one variable should have most of its loading on one factor 3.A
    factor should have good internal consistency (a common (and maybe
    overused) method is Cronbach's alpha) 4.Factors should make
    theoretical sense

Snapshot of an example output below:   

+ The first column is the labels of the observed variables 
+ Columns 2 -- 5 are the latent variable loadings for each of those observed variables. 
+ The first three factors each have 3+  of the observed variables 
+ Length is problematic here

![Example of variable loadings](Images/Wk5/Loading_example.png)

### Preparation

1.  Remove outcome variables, categorical variables, ordinal variables

2.  Visualise the prepared dataset

3.  Inspect correlations (guidelines exist!)

4. Perform some EFA specific tests to determine if a factor analysis is
feasible + KMO + Bartlett's test of sphericity + Parallel analysis +
Scree test (visualization) + Packages in R support these

![Example of variable loadings](Images/Wk5/ExamplePrep.png)

5. If the indications are good -- then perform a factor analysis

Guidelines exist for all of the following: 

1. Look for patterns inside
the factors 

2. Look for patterns between the factors 

3. Look for
communalities 

4. Look for factor correlations 

5. Test for internal
consistency of the factors 

6. Draw! Report!

## Practice

You will need to review the Birthweight example to be able to complete
WBA5.

You can choose any of the three examples to explore the process of
Factor Analysis.

# Binomial Test

## Lecture material

Watch the Lecture on the Binomial test
[here](https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2630de43-3d48-4bf7-b785-b26f00ad5db6). 

## Running the code in the lecture

Please note that binomial test will not be covered in the Week 5 lab - as described in the lecture, this is a very straightforward test to run in R that can be performed with just a single line of code. 

To run the binomial test based on the example described in the lecture, you would simply run the following code in R:

```{r}
binom.test(13, 14, 0.5)
```
## Independent learning activities

Below are some independent learning activities you can have a go at. These are optional, but recommended to help you consolidate the content covered in the lecture. The answers are found below.

### Activity 1

**One sample-test or binomial test?**

Disclaimer: All of these statistics are made up.

The answers are in the next section.

For the following examples, write down whether you think the test conducted should be a one-sample t-test or a binomial test. 

1. You are the coach of a football team. You are interested in whether the running distance of your players significantly differs from the England national football team. You know, on average, England football players run 10km per game. 

2. You are the coach of a football team. You are interested in whether the proportion of games your team scores a goal is significantly different from that of the England national team. You know that on average, the England national team scores a goal in 60% of games. 

3. You are a neonatal doctor (a doctor who specialising in caring for newborn babies). You think that babies born in your hospital are quite small. You are interested in whether the proportion of babies who are classed as “small for gestational age” differs between your hospital and the UK average (10%). 

4. You are a neonatal doctor (a doctor who specialising in caring for newborn babies). You think that babies that are born in your hospital are quite small. You are interested in whether the average weight of babies born at your hospital is significantly less than the UK average (3350g). 


### Activity 2

**Identifying “success”**

1. You are the headteacher of a grammar school which has an entrance exam. You are interested in whether the proportion of children failing the test differs significantly from last year. The failure rate last year was 24% (or 0.24 expressed as a proportion). 

2. You are a teacher. You are interested in whether the proportion of students in your class with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) significantly differs from the year group average (27%, or 0.27 expressed as a proportion). 

3. You have developed a new flu vaccine. You are interested in whether the proportion of people who develop side effects after your vaccine differs from the flu vaccine currently used by the NHS (37%, or 0.37 expressed as a proportion).  

### Answers

#### Activity 1:

1. One-sample t-test. The value for each individual is continuous.You are interested in whether the mean number of km runs differs from a known value. 

2. Binomial test. Two possible outcomes: team scores or team does not score). You are interested in whether the proportion that a given outcome occurs (i.e. your team scores a goal) differs from a known value. 

3. Binomial test. Two possible outcomes: Each baby’s outcome is either “small for gestational age” or “not small for gestational age”. You are interested in whether the proportion that a given outcome occurs (i.e. small for gestational age) differs from a known value.

4. One-sample t-test. The value for each individual is continuous. You are interested in whether the mean weight of babies at your hospital differs from a known value.

Take-home message: A one sample t-test is used when you are interested in comparing the mean of a sample to a known value. The binomial test is used when you are interested in comparing a sample’s proportion of “successes” to a known value.

#### Activity 2

1. Success: failing the test.
   Failure: passing the test.
   
2. Success: Has special educational needs.
   Failure: Does not have special educational needs.
   
3. Success: Has side effects.
   Failure: Does not have side effects.
   
Take home message: Success refers to the outcome you are interested in. Sometimes this might be counterintuitive to how we typically think about ‘success’. 

## Asking questions

If you have any questions about the binomial test, please post them on the discussion board on moodle. If you prefer to remain anonymous, there is a qualtrics link on moodle called "The Binomial Test: Post questions anonymously" where you can ask your questions. I will then copy your question to the discussion forum and answer it there and/or cover it in next Q&A session.
