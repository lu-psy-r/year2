## Research Question 1

You are a psychology lecturer. You hear that the library is offering three statistics courses. You are interested in whether students who attend the courses perform significantly differently from each other.

You recruit 18 people and assign each one to a course. After the courses are finished, you ask them to write an R script. You time how long it takes students to complete the task. You are interested in whether there is a significant effect of course on the time taken to complete the task.

## Research Question 2

You are a developmental psychologist. You are interested in whether working memory develops between 15 and 17 years of age.

You recruit a sample of adolescents and test them on a working memory task when they are 15 years of age, 16 years of age, and 17 years of age. 

You then examine whether there is a significant effect of age on working memory score.
