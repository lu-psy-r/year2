## Differences between means

T-tests helps answer the question:
+ 'Is there a difference between two groups in performance on X?'

ANOVA helps answer the question:
+ 'Is there a difference between two or more groups / factors in performance on X?'

With a 3rd variable we can see if this affects performace at different levels – we can introduce an interaction term...

## Association:  Correlation -> Regression

Measures of association help answer the question 'What is the relationship between two variables?'

Correlation looks at pairs of variables

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']

  tab1 -> tab2 [dir='both'];
}
  
  [1]: 'X'
  [2]: 'Y'
  ") 
```


Regressions chooses one as the outcome variable & one as the predictor variable
+ Simple regression = 1 outcome and 1 predictor

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']

  tab1 -> tab2;
}
  
  [1]: 'X'
  [2]: 'Y'
  ") 
```

+ Multiple regression = 1 outcome and 1+ predictor
  + Interactions also possible

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']
  tab3 [label = '@@3']

  tab1 -> tab3;
  tab2 -> tab3;

  {rank=same; tab1, tab2}

}
  
  [1]: 'X1'
  [2]: 'X2'
  [3]: 'Y'
  ") 
```


## Mediation: a causal model

Mediation helps answer the question:
+ 'how does a predictor variable (X) influence / effect the outcome variable (Y)?'

We assume a third variable is involved
+ The third variable is called the mediator (M)
+ It is situated between the predictor (X) and outcome variable (Y)

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [fontname = arial, shape = circle]
  ranksep = .5;

  tab1 [label = 'X']
  tab2 [label = 'M']
  tab3 [label = 'Y']

  tab1 -> tab3;
  tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3;


}
  ") 
```

## Mediation: parts of the model

Unmediated relationship
+ path of total effect = c

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']

  tab1 -> tab2 [label = 'c'];
}
  
  [1]: 'X'
  [2]: 'Y'
  ") 
```

Mediated relationship
+ mediator variable (M)
+ path of indirect effect = ab
  + a = X predicts M
  + b = M predicts Y
+ path of direct effect = c’
+ ab + c’ = c = total effect of X on Y
  + either partial or full mediation


```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [fontname = arial, shape = circle]
  ranksep = .5;

  tab1 [label = 'X']
  tab2 [label = 'M']
  tab3 [label = 'Y']

  tab1 -> tab3 [label = 'c`'];
  tab1 -> tab2 [label = 'a'];
  tab2-> tab3 [label = 'b'];


}
  ") 
```

## Mediation: conditions

1. X need not be a significant predictor of Y
2. M must not be a primary predictor variable
3. M must not be any of the study conditions
4. M must be dependent upon X
5. M must reduce or eradicate the impact of X on Y

## Mediation: Different types: partial and full

When path c’ is reduced but non-zero
Mediation is said to be partial

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [fontname = arial, shape = circle]
  ranksep = .5;

  tab1 [label = 'X']
  tab2 [label = 'M']
  tab3 [label = 'Y']

  tab1 -> tab3 [label = 'c` >0'];
  tab1 -> tab2 [label = '>0 a'];
  tab2-> tab3 [label = 'b >0'];


}
  ") 
```

When path c’ is at 0
Mediation is said to be complete or full

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [fontname = arial, shape = circle]
  ranksep = .5;

  tab1 [label = 'X']
  tab2 [label = 'M']
  tab3 [label = 'Y']

  tab1 -> tab3 [label = 'c` =0'];
  tab1 -> tab2 [label = '>0 a'];
  tab2-> tab3 [label = 'b >0'];


}
  ") 
```

But be mindful of power – bootstrap method offers strongest solution here.

## Additional assumptions to the linear model assumptions

A mediated model follows all the assumptions of linear regression

As an explanatory process, a predictor (X) can be said to be ‘causally’ related to the outcome (Y) when:
+ X is associated with Y
+ X precedes changes in Y
+ No other unmeasured variables are related to X and also affect Y

X should / could precede M in time

M should significantly predict Y but Y could also significantly predict M
+ M and Y could be correlated if they are both causally related to X. 
+ Swapping the order of variables can check this
High power
+Study design can help this: from weakest to strongest for assumptions
  +Cross-sectional design (v. popular in student projects – beware…)
  +Panel designs that allow for staggered measurement in waves
  +Experimental designs with random assignment and manipulated variables

## Method: 4 step approach (Baron & Kenny, 1986)

### Step 1:

Test path of total effect
=    Test the significance of slope c
=    Linear regression of X on Y
 𝑌=𝑏_(0  ) + 𝑏_1 𝑋
= a simple, straightforward simple regression

### Step 2 & 3:

Test path of indirect effect a and b
=    Test the significance of slope a and slope b in two independent models
=    Linear regression of X on M
 M =𝑏_(0  )+ 𝑏_1 𝑋
=    Linear regression of M on Y while controlling for X
=     Y =𝑏_(0  )+𝑏_1 𝑋+𝑏_2 𝑀

### Step 4:

Test if c’ < c
=     $Y=b_0=  b_1X + b_2M$ 
(step 3 and 4 are in the same equation / model)

If c’ is significant = partial mediation
If c’ is non- significant = full mediation

## Method: Bootstrap test(Preacher & Hayes, 2004, 2008)

+ Automated process
+ Resampling method for the indirect pathway using the model data with replacement
+ Indirect pathway (ab) estimated for each set of sampled data
+ Average = indirect effect estimate
+ Generates confidence intervals also
+ `mediation` package (Tingley et al., 2013) in R

## Reporting Results

Report the indirect effect and its confidence intervals
+ This is generally the effect with the most power
+ A nonsignificant test for c’ may occur due to low power 
  + i.e. give a Type II Error 
  + Be careful of claiming full / complete mediation given this information
Report each pathway with either its significance value or confidence interval
+ Pathways a, b, c’ and c
Discuss how the additional assumptions of mediation analysis are met
Muller et al. (2008) give further details.

## Interpreting Results

+ Benefits of a direct effect in the context of a significant indirect effect (partial mediation) – it informs theory development
+ Size of the indirect effect indicates the strength of mediation
+ Zhao et al. (2010) gave descriptive labels to mediation as a function of the directions of effect for the direct and indirect pathways:
  + Complementary – effects for both pathways are in the same direction
  + Competitive – effects for both pathways are in opposite directions

## Extensions

Hayes (2018)  talks about:
+ Moderated mediation
+ The mediator depends on a fourth variable (!eek) and it could be
+ partial moderated mediation
+ conditional moderated mediation
+ moderated moderated mediation

Out of scope for this module, but have a think when you are designing your studies!


## Demonstration 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(effects)
library(broom)
library(gridExtra)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(diagram)
library(mediation)
library(haven) # reading in .sav file
```

### Mediation analysis

In this demonstration, we will model a mediation analysis. The total effect of an unmediated relationship is below in pathway c.

```{r}
data <- c(0, "a", 0,
          0, 0, 0, 
          "b", "c", 0)
M<- matrix (nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow = TRUE, data=data)
plot<- plotmat (M, pos=c(1,2), 
                name= c( "M",
                         "Supervision", 
                         "Dissertation \nPerformance"), 
                box.type = "rect", 
                box.size = 0.12, 
                box.prop=0.5,  
                curve=0)

```

We are going to test for the mediator variable of `self esteem`.  This needs the prime mark added to the direct pathway "c" text!

```{r}
data <- c(0, "a", 0,
          0, 0, 0, 
          "b", "c", 0)
M<- matrix (nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow = TRUE, data=data)
plot<- plotmat (M, pos=c(1,2), 
                name= c( "Self-esteem",
                         "Supervision", 
                         "Dissertation \nPerformance"), 
                box.type = "rect", 
                box.size = 0.12, 
                box.prop=0.5,  
                curve=0)

```

### Read in the data

First download the data file from [here](data/Wk4/mediation exercise 2 data.sav) and upload to the R server.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
d_full <- read_sav("mediation exercise 2 data.sav")

head(d_full)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
d_full <- read_sav("data/Wk4/mediation exercise 2 data.sav")

head(d_full)
```

Early in the construction of the script, I noticed that there were different levels of missingness across the models - this means that coefficients are estimated on different datasets, so we are introducing a potential source of systematic error if we do not correct for this.

Checking for missingness:
```{r}
summary(d_full)
```
For the purposes of this analysis, I will remove the observations (rows) with NA values. This is not the best way of working with missingness, but for the purposes of the demonstration it is ok.

```{r}
d <- na.omit(d_full) # 4 observations removed
summary(d) # no NA values listed
```

I am going to copy and rename the variables to save on typing

 X = supervision
 Y = dissertation_performance
 M = self_esteem
 
```{r}
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(X = supervision,
         Y = dissertation_performance,
         M = self_esteem)
```
 

### Longhand - Steps of Baron & Kenny (1986)

Four independent linear regression models

  1. The effect of X on Y (total effect = pathway c)
  2. The effect of X on M (indirect effect pathway a)
  3. The effect of M on Y (indirect effect pathway b) while controlling for X
  4. The effect of X and M on Y (for direct effect estimation = pathway c')
  
When running your models, you need to assign them to objects in the environment to then be able to use them in a call to the `mediation` package.

#### Step 1: Test the total effect - pathway c



$$
Y = b_0 + b_1 * X + e
$$

via a simple regression model:

```{r total effect}
(fit_total <-  summary(lm(Y ~ X, d)))
```

The total effect of our predictor on our outcome is significant.  In other words, supervision on dissertation performance is significant (*p* < .001). A change in one unit of supervision is associated with an increase in dissertation performance of 0.44.

There is an effect that can be tested for mediation.

#### Step 2: Test the a pathway of the indirect effect

$$
M = b_0 + b_1 * X + e
$$
a second simple regression model, using X as a predictor but this time, M (self esteem here) is our outcome variable:

```{r indirect effect a}
(fit_indirecta <- summary(lm(M ~ X, d)))
```

The indirect effect pathway a (X on M) is also significant (*p* = .009). A change in one unit of supervision is associated with an increase in self-esteem of 0.30.

So now we know that X and M share some variance - they are correlated.  We have met one of the assumptions that we need to be able to perform a mediation analysis.

#### Step 3 & 4: Test the b pathway of the indirect effect & the direct effect (pathway c')

$$
Y = b_0 + b_1 * X + b_2 * M + e
$$
A multiple regression model, with Y (dissertation performance) as our outcome variable, and X (supervision) and M (self-esteem) as predictors.  Remember that this model is controlling for the effect of X on Y, because interpreting one predictor in a multiple regression model always assumes that the effect of the other predictors are already taken care of, or controlled for.

```{r indirect effect b}
(fit_indirectb <- summary(lm(Y ~ X + M, d)))
```

The indirect effect pathway b (M on Y), while controlling for X is also significant (*p* < .001). A change in one unit of self-esteem is associated with an increase in dissertation-performance of 0.68 of a unit. The predictor (X) relationship with the outcome (Y and pathway c' - the direct effect) remains significant also (*p* < .02 , but reduced relative to the step 1 model coefficient (step 1 $b$ = 0.44, step 4 $b$ = 0.23).  

Since the direct pathway c' is significant, we can say that we have a partially mediated effect of self-esteem on the relationship between supervision and dissertation performance.  Supervision predicts self esteem and dissertation performance, while self esteem also predicts dissertation performance.

If instead the X coefficient in the model above had been > .05 i.e. no significant, we could have claimed a full or complete mediation of self esteem on the relationship between supervision and dissertation performance

### Using the power of R and the `mediation` package

The `mediation` package is called by the library() function loaded at the top of the document.  

 - It takes the models for pathways a and b (`fit_indirecta` and `fitindirectb` here), 
 - It needs us to tell it the name of the predictor or treatment variable and the name of the mediator variable as labelled in the models 
 - and we set the `boot` argument to T for TRUE, to be able to generate confidence intervals on our co-efficients.

```{r}
results <- mediate(fit_indirecta, 
                   fit_indirectb, 
                   treat = 'X', 
                   mediator = 'M', 
                   boot = T, 
                   dropobs = TRUE)
```

```{r}
summary(results)
```

 - **ACME** stands for *average causal mediation effects* and is the product of pathway a and pathway b from `fit indirecta` (X = 0.3037992) and `fit_indirectb` (M = 0.6786069).
 - **ADE** stands for average direct effects or pathway c'.  This is the X coefficient in our `fit_indirectb`
 - **Total Effect** does what it says on the tin.  It is the sum of the direct and indirect effect, ACME + ADE, and also calculated  as X in model `fit_total`.
 - **Prop. Mediated** is the proportion of the effect of X on Y that goes through M.  We divide ACME (or ab) by the total effect (c).
 
```{r}
plot(results)
```

### Reporting the mediation analysis

and to use our diagram from the top of the document:

We are going to test for the mediator variable of `self esteem`.  (This needs the prime mark added to the direct pathway "c" text!)



```{r}
data <- c(0, 0.30, 0,
          0, 0, 0, 
          0.68, 0.23, 0)
M<- matrix (nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow = TRUE, data=data)
plot<- plotmat (M, pos=c(1,2), 
                name= c( "Self-esteem",
                         "Supervision", 
                         "Dissertation \nPerformance"), 
                box.type = "rect", 
                box.size = 0.12, 
                box.prop=0.5,  
                curve=0)

```
(Remember that these data are not standardised so we cannot compare between them for strength of relationships!)

The effect of supervision on dissertation performance was partially mediated via self-esteem.  The effect of supervision on dissertation performance and the effect of self-esteem on dissertation performance were independently significant predictors.  The indirect effect equals (.3)*(0.68) = .0.21.  We tested the significance of this indirect effect using bootstrapping procedures. We computed the average indirect effect over 1,000 bootstrapped samples with 95% confidence intervals (bootstrapped indirect effect = 0.21 95% CI [0.06, 0.38]). Since the confidence intervals do not cross zero, we infer statistical significance.
