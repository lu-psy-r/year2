# Lab preparation

Before the lab, please watch the following short [video](https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e64d817e-2db7-4a34-aec1-b288009fb38c). This walks you through how to perform a binary logistic regression model in R.

If you want to have a play around with the script yourself, the R markdown script and dataset can be downloaded [here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=2507071).


# Lab

## Overview

Today I’ll provide you with one main research questions which will require you to complete the statistical test covered in the lecture. You can work in groups or individually.

You can write your script as a .R or Rmd file. Use the lab preparation video and script, lecture slides, and previous content covered in the statistics modules to help you.

The presentation given at the start of the lab can be downloaded [here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2604321).

## Datasets

The datasets for this lab can be downloaded [here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=2507073).

## Main research Question

You are interested in whether the country an individual lives (UK/Australia) predicts reptile ownership (Yes/No). The dataset to use is "reptile_data.csv"

In the dataset, the outcome variable (reptile) is coded as "Y" and "N":

- Y = Yes
- N = No

To make sure we should all end up with the same output, set UK as your reference category.

## Optional extra dataset

I've also uploaded a second dataset (pen_colour.csv). If you finish the above analysis, you could have a go at performing a binary logistic regression model on tbis dataset as well. Alternatively, you could attempt this after the lab. The dataset (pen_colour.csv) can be downloaded using the link under the "Datasets" heading above.

Here, you are interested in whether pen colour (Black/Blue) predicts whether an individual passes their exam (Yes/No). 

Set black as the reference category.

## Hints and tips

Your script should aim to answer and interpret the research question above. 

Start a new session on the server, then load in the required libraries (tidyverse, DescTools) and the dataset.

1. Prepare our data for analysis
2. Explore our data
3. Run the binary logistic regression model
4. Evaluate the model
5. Evaluate the individual predictors
6. Predicted probabilities
7. Interpret the output


## Model script 

A model script showing one way of answering the reptile research question above using R will be available [here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2507075) from 9am on Monday of Week 19. 

A model script showing one way of answering the (optional) pen research question will be available [here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2507076) from 9am on Monday of Week 19.

# Independent learning activities 

Below are some independent learning activities you can have a go at to help consolidate the content. These are optional, but recommended. Activity 1 is the WBA. Activities 2 and 3 are further activities to help you consolidate the content.

## Activity 1: The WBA

The WBA can be accessed [here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/quiz/view.php?id=2506936) from 27th February 2025. Each student gets three attempts. We recommend having a go at the WBA following the lecture and lab. We recommend saving at least one attempt for revision purposes close in time to the class test.

## Activity 2: Calculating odds ratios manually

This activity will involve work with the following data. You are a researcher interested in whether being excited (yes/no) predicts whether an individual passes their driving test (yes/no). Here is a table of frequencies.

```{r echo = FALSE} 

knitr::include_graphics("data/Wk8/Week8_worksheet1.png")
```

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 1: What are the odds of passing the driving test in the “Excited – Yes” group?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 2: What are the odds of passing the driving test in the “Excited – No” group?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 3: What is the odds ratio (where “Excited – No” is the original odds)?**</span>
 
<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 4: What does this odds ratio mean?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 5: Is there evidence of quasi-complete separation or complete separation here? Give a reason for your answer.**</span>

### Activity 2 answers:

**What are the odds of passing the driving test in the “Excited – Yes” group?**

<span style="color:purple">1.1666666668</span>

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## How was this calculated?

Here is how this answers were computed:

The probability of individuals who are excited (Excited – Yes) passing the driving test:

14/26 = 0.5384615385

14 is the number of participants who were excited and passed the driving test. 

26 is the total number of individuals who responded “Excited – Yes” (14+12)

The probability of individuals who are excited (Excited – Yes) not passing the driving test: 

12/26 = 0.4615384615

12 is the number of participants who were excited and did not pass the driving test.

26 is the total number of individuals who responded “Excited – Yes” (14+12)

The odds of individuals who are excited passing the driving test:

0.5384615385 / 0.4615384615 = 1.1666666668

Answer = 1.1666666668

:::

**What are the odds of passing the driving test in the “Excited – No” group?**

<span style="color:purple">0.275862069</span>

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## How was this calculated?

The probability of individuals who are not excited (Excited – No) passing the driving test:

8/37 = 0.216216216

8 is the number of participants who were not excited and passed the driving test. 

37 is the total number of individuals who responded “Excited – No” (8+29)

The probability of individuals who are excited (Excited - No) not passing the driving test:

29/37 = 0.783783783

29 is the number of participants who were not excited and did not pass the driving test. 

37 is the total number of individuals who responded “Excited – No” (8+29)

The odds of individuals who are not excited passing the driving test:

0.216216216 / 0.783783783 = 0.275862069

:::

**What is the odds ratio (where “Excited – No” is the original odds)?**

<span style="color:purple">4.23</span>

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## How was this calculated?

1.1666666668  / 0.275862069 = 4.23

The odds ratio = 4.23

:::
 
**What does this odds ratio mean?**

<span style="color:purple">Individuals who were excited had a 4.23x higher odds of passing the driving test relative to individuals who were not excited.</span>

**Is there evidence of quasi-complete separation or complete separation here? Give a reason for your answer.**

<span style="color:purple">No – all cells have quite a few observations. There is no evidence of quasi-complete separation or complete separation.</span>

## Activity 3:

Activity 2 examines the following research question. You are a researcher interested in
whether social media use (< 2 hours per day / > 2 hours per day) predicts whether an individual reports difficulty falling asleep (yes/no). Here is a table of
frequencies:

```{r echo = FALSE} 

knitr::include_graphics("data/Wk8/Week8_worksheet2.png")
```
You analyse this data in R and the output of your model is below. For the outcome, you set
“0” as “Reports difficulty falling asleep - No” and “1” as “Reports difficulty falling asleep - Yes”.

#### Model output

Here is the model output:

```{r echo = FALSE} 
sleep_data <- read_csv("data/Wk8/l8_worksheet2.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

sleep_data$sleep_numeric <- recode(sleep_data$Difficulty_falling_asleep, "No" = 0, "Yes"= 1) 

sleep_data$Social_media_use <- as.factor(sleep_data$Social_media_use)

sleep_model <- glm(sleep_numeric ~ Social_media_use, data = sleep_data, family = binomial())

summary(sleep_model)
```
#### Evaluating the model output

You run some code to produce the model’s chi-square statistic, the degrees of freedom and the p-value. These are displayed below. Use this to answer the following question:

Chi square = 8.20
Degrees of freedom = 1
P-value = 0.004

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 1: What do these values indicate?**</span>

#### Evaluating Pseudo R2

Here are the Pseudo R2 values. Use this output to answer the following two questions:
```{r echo = FALSE} 
PseudoR2(sleep_model, which = "all")
```

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 2: Which Pseudo R2 values might you report (based on the lecture)?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 3: What are the value of these Pseudo R2s?**</span>

#### Evaluating the individual predictors

Look back at the summary output. Use this output to answer the following four questions:

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 4: What is the reference category for the predictor “Social media use”?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 5: What does the Intercept Estimate represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 6: What does the Social_media_use> 2 hours Estimate represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 7: From the p-value in the summary table for the Social_media_use >2 hours row, what can you conclude?**</span>


##### Exponentiating the estimates:

Here are the exponentiated values. Use this output to answer the following three questions: 

```{r echo = FALSE} 
(sleep_model_exponentiated <- exp(sleep_model$coefficients))
```

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 8: What does the Intercept represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 9: What does the Social_media_use> 2 hours value represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 10: Can you interprert the Social_media_use> 2 hours value?**</span>

##### Confidence intervals:

Here are the confidence intervals. Use this output to answer the following question: 

```{r echo= FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sleep_model_odds_confidence_intervals <- exp(confint(sleep_model))
sleep_model_odds_confidence_intervals
```

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 11: What does the Social_media_use >2 hours 95% confidence intervals represent?**</span>


### Activity 3 answers:

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 1: What do these values indicate?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">$x^{2}$(1) = 8.20, *p* = .004.

<span style="color:purple">This indicates that adding the “Social media” variable to our model significantly improved the fit, compared to the null model containing intercept only</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 2: Which Pseudo R2 values might you report (based on the lecture)?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">McFadden, CoxSnell and Nagelkerke</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 3: What are the value of these Pseudo R2s?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">
McFadden = 0.19, CoxSnell = 0.16, Nagelkerke = 0.27</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 4: What is the reference category for the predictor “Social media”?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">< 2 hours is our reference category for the social media variable</span>

<span style="color:purple">***QUESTION 5: What does the Intercept Estimate represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">The log odds of someone with a social media value of < 2 hours reporting difficulties falling asleep</span>.

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 6: What does the Social_media_use> 2 hours Estimate represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">The change in the log odds of having a difficulty falling asleep value of “Yes” when going from the reference category (social_media< 2 hours) to social_media> 2 hours</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 7: From the p-value in the summary table for the Social_media_use >2 hours row, what can you conclude?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">Daily social media use (< 2 hours vs > 2 hours) significantly predicts whether an individual has difficulties falling asleep (yes/no; *p* = .005)</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 8: What does the Intercept represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">The odds of reporting difficulties falling asleep for individuals who have social media use of < 2 hours a day.</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 9: What does the Social_media_use> 2 hours value represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">The change in odds (i.e. the odds ratio) of reporting difficulties falling asleep (i.e. difficulties falling asleep = yes) when going from Social_media_use< 2 hours to Social_media_use> 2 hours</span>

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 10: Can you interprert the Social_media_use> 2 hours value?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">The odds of reporting difficulties falling asleep are 11.33x higher if your social media use is >2 hours a day than if your social media use is <2 hours a day</span>.

<span style="color:purple">**QUESTION 11: What does the Social_media_use >2 hours 95% confidence intervals represent?**</span>

<span style="color:purple">The 95% confidence around the odds ratio (for the comparison between Social_media_use < 2 hours to Social_media_use > 2 hours).</span>
