Welcome to Year 2 statistics!
:::

This year you will have the opportunity to build on the skills you developed last year - both in terms of statistical expertise and data coding in R. The year, you will complete two statistics modules: 

- PSYC214: Statistics for group comparisons, with Sam Russell and Mark Hurlstone

- PSYC234: Statistics: from association to modelling causality, with Emma Mills and Amy Atkinson

The Year 2 teaching team are looking forward to meeting you and working with you to develop your statistical expertise and data analysis skills further!
